# Piano Playing

Project : Make & publish an open-source (web) service running on my rasbperry pi.
My project : open - source Piano web service using Apache(or nginx), PHP , MySQL 
(source code :  html, javascript) 

Goals : Simple piano playing
        It is used as a toy piano for young children, and can be used as a piano for adults to perform simple or check piano notes. 

Contribution : There are many piano applications on the Internet, but there was no way to implement them directly on the website.
                So, using Raspberry Pi, I created a website where I can practice piano through a web server.  
                I used html, javascript, and css for this website, so I think anyone can use this code elsewhere, and others can modify the                 code to make a better site.
        
Code required : 
  1) html file
  2) piano notes sound (.mp3)
  3) piano picture
